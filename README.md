# SQL_Demo_Obsidian
## Small project showcasing my general knowledge of SQL using Obsidian Dataview.
The Project is a demo of SQL calls in a domain of a dental firm and does record calls and basic arithmetic, and is a simple visualization of how an administrator would see all the data of all the general tasks in the office.
